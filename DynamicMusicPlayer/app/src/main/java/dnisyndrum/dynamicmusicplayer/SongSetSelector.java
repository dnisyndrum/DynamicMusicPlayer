A SongSetSelector object is created in order to determine which SongSet
object to tell to play music. It creates one CurrentTime object and one
CurrentSpeed object to determine that. Each of those two objects are
created and deleted each time this object checks the current time and
speed. The user is able to adjust how long the app waits to transition
between SongSets when there is a speed or time change.
